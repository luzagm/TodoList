# To do list

This project consists of different elements to type and save a list of our daily tasks.

## Requirements
- [✔] It must be a React app
- [✔] It must use TypeScript and Hooks.
- [✔] It must have an input to type the tasks and an area for the list of tasks.
- [✔] It must have handling functions to update, select and remove the tasks.
- [-] Add routing to see a description of each task.
- [-] Add a localStorage to save the list.

## How to run the project

This project was created using [React-Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)
<br/>
Once everything is installed, you can run the project using:

### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Comments
This has been my first contact with TypeScript and Hooks after learning JavaScript and ReactJs. I spent a few days just reading documentation and practicing with smaller projects. When I felt confident enough, I decided to give it a try.<br/>
I'm sure there are things that I could improve (and probably will do in the future).
